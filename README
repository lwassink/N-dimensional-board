This repository impliments a ruby NBoard class.
An instance of NBoard is an n-dimensional grid of positions, each of which can hold an arbitrary value.
Values can be accessed and set using the NBoard#[] and NBoard[]= methods, and there are also methods for printing the board, and for looping over its contents or positions.
